# Password Generator Challenge

## Description

The goal is to create an application that runs and alerts in a browser and an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. 

The password can include numbers, lower and upper case characters and special characters.

The completed project should look like the image below:

## Workings

The interface should:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
